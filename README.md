### Project: Bank Customer Segmentation and Insurance Claim Prediction

###### Course: Data Mining

###### The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.

###### Case Study 1: I have used Clustering for Bank Customer Segmentation(Python File + Business Report + Dataset).
###### Case Study 2: Here I have used CART, RF, ANN Insurance Claim Prediction(Python File + Business Report + Dataset).

###### Skills and Tools: Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks
